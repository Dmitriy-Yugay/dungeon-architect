# Project Context

## Vision

Dungeon Architect is a dungeon-builder tower defense game. Instead of invading
a dungeon, the player creates one: shaping routes and placing defenses to stop
increasingly dangerous parties of heroes.

## Product pillars

- **Meaningful construction:** layout decisions change hero movement and
  defensive opportunities.
- **Readable defense:** the player can understand why a defense succeeded or
  failed.
- **Strategic variety:** different layouts and defense combinations support
  multiple solutions.
- **Fast iteration:** rebuilding after a wave should be quick and rewarding.

## Initial scope

The first playable version should include:

- a grid-based dungeon with an entrance and a protected objective;
- placeable paths, rooms, and a small set of defenses;
- heroes that navigate the dungeon and attack the objective;
- waves, resources, win/loss states, and a basic build/combat cycle;
- desktop support with placeholder visuals and audio.

## Out of scope for the first version

Multiplayer, procedural campaigns, advanced progression, mod support, and
additional platforms are deferred until the core loop is proven.

## Current state

The repository contains a runnable Kotlin and libGDX desktop project split into
`core` and `lwjgl3` modules. The current prototype renders a selectable dungeon
grid with an entrance and objective. Enemy movement, tower placement, combat,
assets, and audio have not been implemented.
